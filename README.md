# Do electoral democracies attract more Foreign direct investments?
The presence of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is widely regarded as crucial for fostering economic growth, particularly in developing nations. Increased FDI often translates to more capital influx, enabling industrialization and supporting economic advancement. Factors that attract FDI typically encompass political stability and secure property rights, commonly associated with democratic governance. Democratic regimes, with their checks and balances, tend to safeguard private property rights and cultivate a stable business environment. Therefore, the process of democratization potentially enhances FDI and subsequently propels economic growth.
Nevertheless, recent success stories from certain illiberal regimes, such as China and the Asian developmental states, as well as the emergence of illiberalism in several countries like Hungary, challenge these conventional beliefs. This prompts an essential inquiry into whether electoral democracies indeed draw more FDI. This research focuses on FDI as the outcome variable, electoral democracy as the causal variable, and countries as the subjects of analysis. Additionally, potential confounding variables include population, GDP per capita (GDPPC), and the labor force.
Population and the labor force may inadvertently attract FDI. Illiberal regimes often control reproductive rights, potentially leading to population growth, thereby expanding markets and enticing foreign investment. Similarly, a burgeoning labor force resulting from high population growth could attract foreign firms seeking labor. Moreover, GDPPC can act as a common cause confounder. A lower GDPPC usually aligns with lower living standards, reduced education levels, and instability, all of which may lead to the prevalence of illiberal regimes. Conversely, lower GDPPC might offer lower wages, incentivizing manufacturing firms to relocate operations.
Data for FDI, GDPPC, population, and the labor force is sourced from the World Bank's databank. FDI is measured as the net investment inflow divided by GDP (% of GDP), while GDPPC is measured in constant 2015 US dollars. The measure of electoral democracy is derived from V-Dem Core v13, utilizing the Polyarchy Index (v2x_polyarchy) ranging between 0-1 (higher values indicating greater democratic attributes). The dataset comprises 217 countries from 2002 to 2021, with 156 countries remaining after excluding missing values for the relevant variables. The resulting panel data is balanced.
To explore the long-term effects of democratization over time, both fixed-effect (FE) and first-difference (FD) models are employed. Notably, the impact of democratization on FDI might be more pronounced in developing countries than in developed ones due to their varying stages of development. Consequently, after conducting regressions on all countries, the sample is segregated into low-income and high-income countries based on the median GDPPC in 2002 (3358$). Low-income countries are defined as those with GDPPC lower than 1208.59$ in 2002, comprising 78 countries, while the remainder constitutes high-income countries. FE and FD regression analyses are conducted separately on each subgroup, with the FD models incorporating lags and leads to capture temporal effects and potential reverse causality, respectively.
